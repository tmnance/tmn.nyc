Notes:
I have moved the project away from the standard compass libraries and onto the Bourbon library. We are still using the compass framework to compile, watch, and maintain our project.

Changes:
	/*
	Bourbon uses a standard @display() mixin which accepts the display type as its argument.
	*/

	@display-flex()			->	@display( flex );
	@display-inline-flex()	->	@display( inline-flex );


	/*
	_colors.scss has been integrated into _variables.scss
	Place all variables in there, and we won't have to hunt for specific things we need.
	*/

	/*
	The @arrow() mixin is now a wrapper for bourbon's nicer @triangle() mixin. We should move to using @triangle going forward but I'm leaving in @arrow() for now.

	@triangle() doesn't support unitless sizes, nor should it. Let's be explicit. :)
	*/

	@arrow( direction, size-x, size-y, color );
	@triangle( size-x, size-y, color, direction );

	/*
	Removed fine-tune-vertical-box-centering() from _mixins.scss, it was just a mixin for adding padding-top to things.
	*/

	@fine-tune-verttical-box-centering()	->	DEAD;

	/*
	Removed @placeholder() from _mixins.scss, bourbon already has it. Works the same way.
	/*
